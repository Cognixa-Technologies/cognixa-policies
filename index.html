  <h1>Security Policy for Developing</h1>

  <h2>Section 1: Contribution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All contributions must be made as pull requests, which can only be accepted after security checks the file. No Exceptions.</li>
    <li>Intentionally Malicious code will be blame linked and the author(s) placed on warning or immediately removed.</li>
    <li>Please hold backups of your work securely under some form of encryption <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> provided by Security.</li>
    <li>Ensure your Environment Variables are encrypted STRICTLY under AES-GCM, using the shared key for Environment Variables.</li>
    <li>Contributed code must have full explanations of changes and a short reference name that must strictly be <code>Initials-Short Date-Version</code> (For example <code>OA-5.11.2024-0.1.0</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 2: Writing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All code must be checked by security before publishing as mentioned in section 1 point 1.</li>
    <li>Written code must be fully debugged by the writer.</li>
    <li>Methods like <code>exec()</code> are NEVER to be used around user input.</li>
    <li>Attempt to use Context Handlers, Decorators, Functions and Type Checkers where ever possible to remove room for error. <a href="#">[2]</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 3: Test Hosting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Test hosting instances of Cognixa Core must be done when the main instance is available, or on your own bot instance.</li>
    <li>Be wary of sending data over public networks (avoid where possible)</li>
    <li>If utilising a Dual-Wrapper <a href="#">[3]</a> for the bot, please avoid leaving ports exposed on your device when you are not testing (for example if you are calling to a function server <a href="#">[4]</a> on the main port)</li>
  </ul>
